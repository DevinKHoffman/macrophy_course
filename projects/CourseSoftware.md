# Required and suggested software
This course will include in-class demos and projects requiring the use of phylogenetics and statistical software. Some of this software will be required for you to install, while some software are merely suggestions for you to improve your computational workflows and productivity. This document may be updated as the course progresses.

## Required Software
### _R, Rstudio and Phylogenetics packages_
1. Download and Install [Rstudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop)
2. Make sure that your version of R > version 3.4
3. You will need a number of R packages throughout the course, and can install them as they are introduced. However, one easy way to prepare is to install the R package "ctv" and install ALL phylogenetics packages at once by using the [Phylogenetics Taskview](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Phylogenetics.html). This will take up to an hour to complete, so make sure you can let it run for a while. However, it's an easy way to be prepared for whatever analyses you may need in the future. 
```
install.packages("ctv")
ctv::install.views("Phylogenetics")
```
### _RevBayes_
Download and install [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io/software.html)

### _Optional software (subject to promotion to required, good to have regardless!)_
[MrBayes](http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/download.php) (Bayesian inference of phylogenies)
[PAUP*](http://phylosolutions.com/paup-test/) Time-tested software for running parsimony and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses

### _Other software_
[git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03) Version control software that will allow you to connect to interact with my course [github page](https://github.com/uyedaj/macrophy_course)
